Oh what a tangled web we weave. I'm not really sure what's going on with this one or how I got here, I wanted to explore a search I had seen on Shodan called "3cx servers bcn" but now I'm trapped in a digital hall of mirrors. [3CX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3CX_Phone_System) is a private telephone exchange that sometimes runs over [VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP), and has servers that typically tend to run on 5001.

## Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³ on 62.23.216.99
So I looked for things running on ports 5001. One of the first ones I saw was named "Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³" which, naturally, got me pretty interested.

Going to their IP in a browser automatically tried for https but had a certificate error, and I was really struck by the url for which their certificate had been issued, which is to say that nyc-212.odin.biz sounds fake as hell. Thanks to Azalea Banks I know that 212 is an area code for NYC so at least that checked out with the phone theme. Let's come back to odin.biz in a bit.

Proceeding along to the IP prompts a login for Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³. The login page is very pretty, there is a beach and some birds in the foreground and some mountains in the background. Again, we'll come back to this page later.

The login looked so nice I suspected that it must have a URL.
```
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host 62.23.216.99
99.216.23.62.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mail.mx.vu.
```
Aha mail.mx.vu! So this is doing email or something related. What's mx.vu? It doesn't resolve to anything in the browser. According to Shodan it's in Garden City, Kansas.
```
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host mx.vu
mx.vu has address 209.200.39.39
mx.vu mail is handled by 10 mail.mx.vu.
mx.vu mail is handled by 20 syno.hno3.de.
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host syno.hno3.de
syno.hno3.de has address 89.246.70.219
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host hno3.de
hno3.de has address 80.237.132.25

ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host mx0.hno3.de

```
syno.hno3.de and hno3.de are both in Germany, unsurprisingly.
