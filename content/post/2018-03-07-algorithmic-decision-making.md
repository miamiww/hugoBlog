## Reports, Research Papers, and Press Releases
As a great resource for all of our classes' discussions on AI I want to point out first the AI Now [annual report](https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2017_Report.pdf). AI Now Institute is a research institute (within NYU! we can go talk to them) focused on interdisciplinary research on the social impacts of AI.
