For this assignment I fell off the generative text pathway and onto the well worn path of the media artist: bad generative music compositions with shiny new tools. On my Github feed I noticed that Rebecca Fiebrink had recently created a new repository called word2vec2osc and I realized that I could use word vectors plugged into Wekinator to train a bunch of sine wave generators to turn bodies of text into musical compositions. I started training my model by setting "pleasant" sounding tones to "pleasant" words like "good", "pleasant", "coffee", "comfortable", etc. and unpleasant words to unpleasant tones.
