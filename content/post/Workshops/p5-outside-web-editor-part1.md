## The Workflow
There are many ways to do web development, but for "creative coding on the web" I've found one particular workflow (or "tech stack") to be the most useful. These are the basic elements of that workflow:

* Very basic command line skills
* Very basic html + css and knowledge of Document Object Model (DOM)
* Knowledge of javascript creative coding framework such as P5 or 3js
* Well organized folder structure
* Node.js with express for web servers
* Git
* A virtual machine with ssh access and a static IP address (such as a digital ocean droplet)

That might seem like a lot but you only really need a tiny amount of knowledge in each area to get your foot in the door, and from there your skills can expand outward into the areas that you find most useful for whatever project you are trying to achieve. In part one of this tutorial
