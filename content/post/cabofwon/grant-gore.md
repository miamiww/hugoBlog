The peculiarly named [Grant Gore](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/grant-gore/highlights/12540), a small triangular park at the intersection of Dean and Bedford in Crown Heights ('gore' being an obscure term for any small triangular park), is home to a truly massive bronze statue of Ulysses S Grant, Union hero of the Civil War and two term Reconstruction era president.


On a crisp morning this week I went to take a look at the statue. I was intrigued by the [short bit of history I had read](https://www.brownstoner.com/history/past-and-present-dedicating-grants-statue/) about it and the Gilded Age high society club that had commissioned it, but I also went because I wanted to unpack the inexplicable warmth I feel towards Grant. When I consider Grant I feel an enormous sense of respect, but even moreso, empathy for his humanity, compassion for the weight he must have felt. I have _no_ real idea about the provenance of these feelings, I have no general respect for battlefield heroes, didn't read historical romances of the civil war in my youth. His beard, however, is incredible, and his name equally so, a folding point in human history between two "great men and successful leaders of war". Ulysses had been my favorite Greek hero growing up, I was taken by both his cunning and his deep desire just to get home, when I was young I had a precocious world-weariness and would frequently ask adults - usually my parents and usually in our own home - if I could go home, go somewhere safe and my own. 

Turning the corner from Dean onto Bedford, there is the statue, made by some high society men to celebrate themselves, but also to celebrate Grant and the success of the Union and the booming Union economy that had made them so wealthy, to celebrate their own philanthropy and to mark the spot where they drank and smoked and relaxed, their clubhouse being right across the street. There  at that point, in 1896, Grant had been tarnished by his presidential scandals
