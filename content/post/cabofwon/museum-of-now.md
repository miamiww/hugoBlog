Whenever I imagine the world of the medium-term future looking back on the current time, say 75-100 years from now, which I do reasonably often, I imagine an intense future regret for now. It's a hard emotion to put into words. Maybe a kind of warm nostalgia combined with disgust, the way many Americans now view the 1950s, but mixed in with the sense that this time, the early 20XXs, was a time when wrong choices were made willfully in the face of evidence pointing toward right choices. Choices about climate change, about openness, about global collaboration. Choices about who to trust and when, about the nature of truth, about the structure of institutions.

This is a high level view but any grand political vision of a time colors the view we have of the people living within it. When I think of the 1950s in America, for example, I think of repressed housewives and emotionally distant husbands in the suburbs, a middle class boom, alienation, melodramas, white flight, pastels, tomato aspic, the Beat Generation poets, Jim Crow laws and lynching, authoritatively totalizing yet oddly chipper male television narrators. All of this I put together with my little 1950s narrative, a story of Cold War anxieties, fear and wonder at atomic modernity, the homogenizing steamroller of culture that people believed modern life would usher in, all creating a deep rooted fear of the Other, any and every Other, a fear that expressed itself in a million ways across society.

Authenticity has been the craze of the day in American life for the past 20 years or so
