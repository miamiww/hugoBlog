In starting to make some kind of something that talks I wanted to emulate one of my favorite browser games (is it a game?)
[ClickClickClick](https://clickclickclick.click/).
But I found that I didn't know enough about "The DOM" to get much of my foot in the door without a bunch of research time. So instead I went an easier route, dipping into the familiar warmth of P5. I took a project that I had given a bit of a start to before, a little game about waiting around.

In order to add the speech audio I had to do a lot of refactoring of what I had already done because the text wasn't easily put into a function.

You can see the code
[here](https://github.com/miamiww/HelloComputer/tree/master/talk_to_me).

I took the javascript from the examples in class and more or less used it as is. I don't know if I like it with the voice because it's hard to put the kinds of emotions I am imagining the voice to have into the speech using just this API, I actually think I prefer just-text to the way it is now, but it is good to try different things.
