_"In the end everything's garbage"_ - Nick DiMola (one of my experts)


![](/images/TempExp/trash/Logo2_text.svg)

In trying to step back and synthesize my research I had to step one layer farther and re-ask myself: what have my research questions been and how have I made the connections that I've made?

### Research questions as they have arisen (selected list)

* What is the history of the disposable object?

* How does the disposable object disappear from the point of view of the discarder and what is its end of life cycle?

* How are these systems of throwing out integrated with other areas of modern life?

* What's the garbage supply chain and how is it different from the product supply chain?

* What is the role of discard within production supply chains (what does waste look like in production)?

* What is the connection between throwing out and spiritual cleanliness/holiness (is throwing away a modern holy act)?

* What is the affective experience of the discarder?

* What are the affordances and formal elements of the garbage medium?

* What is the role of the corporation as sellers of abstraction (garbage _removal_ as service)?

* Who are the communities most engaged with garbage and the discard of others?

*  What is a Xenofeminist approach to garbage? (if XF is a politics of alienation then must it be an identification with garbage, i.e. the alienated object)

* Is garbage definable as the alienated object?

* What is an Accelerationist approach to garbage?

* Why is it that e-waste, a type of object not fitting into the past removal strategy paradigm, still forced into the same channels? (i.e. why is there not a new innovative strategy much in the way that recycling was an innovation for an increase in plastics)

* What are the affordances of the e-waste medium?

* What is apocalyptic about garbage, i.e. is the future of garbage necessarily ecological disaster?

* How can we create utopia within the ongoing now given the sloughing off of mountains of trash that every action seems to create?
