_"In the end everything's garbage"_ - Nick DiMola (one of my experts)  

_"Trash carries dystopia within"_ - Maite Zubiaurre

In trying to step back and synthesize my research I had to step one layer farther and re-ask myself: what have my research questions been and how have I made the connections that I've made?

### Research questions as they have arisen (selected list)

* What is the history of the disposable object?

* How does the disposable object disappear from the point of view of the discarder and what is its end of life cycle?

* How are these systems of throwing out integrated with other areas of modern life?

* What's the garbage supply chain and how is it different from the product supply chain?

* What is the role of discard within production supply chains (what does waste look like in production)?

* How does trash travel?

* What is the connection between throwing out and spiritual cleanliness/holiness (is throwing away a modern holy act)?

* What is the affective experience of the discarder?

* What are the affordances and formal elements of the garbage medium?

* What is the role of the corporation as sellers of abstraction (garbage _removal_ as service)?

* Who are the communities most engaged with garbage and the discard of others?

*  What is a Xenofeminist approach to garbage? (if XF is a politics of alienation then must it be an identification with garbage, i.e. the alienated object)

* Is garbage definable as the alienated object?

* What is an Accelerationist approach to garbage?

* Why is it that e-waste, a type of object not fitting into the past removal strategy paradigm, still forced into the same channels? (i.e. why is there not a new innovative strategy much in the way that recycling was an innovation for an increase in plastics)

* What are the affordances of the e-waste medium?

* What is apocalyptic about garbage, i.e. is the future of garbage necessarily ecological disaster?

* How can we create utopia within the ongoing now given the sloughing off of mountains of trash that every action seems to create?

* How are Seasteaders free to imagine and create their odious utopia when the rest of us have to muck about with the real?

Frequently these questions arose in the process of investigation for other questions, though I did not well document the question-arising-process, though I attempted to recreate the temporal flow of my notebooks here.

### Research conclusions
In the process of attempting answers to these questions I reached the following conclusions and strategies.

* E-waste, while itself is a wicked problem, is an area of low-hanging-fruit. Most people are not aware of the problems of e-waste and its disposal, and thus creating a way to educate people in this area is a good lever into helping them into a wider understanding of our garbage culture.

* Garbage as a medium can be hugely good fun. Recontextualizing your own trash as a playful object feels joyful and freeing, and this defamiliarization of the garbage object opens up a space for intervention.

* The the global garbage system itself is overwhelmingly complex. It makes me sick and depressed. I start crying when I think about the number of shipping containers full of waste plastics over the ocean at any time.

* The layers of abstraction and complexities of the global systems in garbage make a systemic subversive intervention difficult. I believe that exaggeration of the features of the system might be a possible lever, and overidentification with the corporations moving in the garbage space seemed like an in to that exageration. An overidentified corporation is a cult.
